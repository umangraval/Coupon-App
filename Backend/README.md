# Coupon-Sails-Backend 

1.	The project milestone has fulfilled all the criteria as follows:
 a.	The new User API has been generated.
 b.	Login in ajax and logout has been according to the requirements.
 c.	Many-to-many association has been setup between the coupons and the users, that too from both the sides.
 d.	The access controls make sure that the rights of admin is intact, same for members and non-members.
 e.	The initial amount of coins given is 1000. And it will reset on drop and safe but not on alter. Hence, it acts like a wallet.
 f.	The quota gets subtracted after every redeem done by the member.
 g.	A three-column card display in my redeemed coupon page helps the member know how many coupons they have already redeemed and what is the remaining balance. 
 h.	Redeem button gets hidden after the redeem has been done, or the user is admin or non-member; or if the coins and/or quota is less than the required for the coupon.
 i.	It adopts the Ajax and RESTful API.
 j.	The admin can see the members who have redeemed a particular coupon from the redeemed members button in the admin page.
 k.	Search has been regenerated with ajax, input validation is done on both client and server side. Even date validation has been added. 
 l.	The defaults routes are disabled. The redirection works fine.
 m.	Committed regularly.
2.	Apart from the aforementioned features, I have made 3 users:
                An Admin named admin with password 123456
                A member named boss with password 123456
                A member named anmol with password 123456
3.	I have implemented console log so that the checking becomes easier for me during development.
4.	The search has not been renamed but the requirements are met, even the date validation has been provided. The search works individual fields or a combination as well.
5.	Once the user log in the logout button appears and login hides and the Hi, username is in place.

All in all, I have tried to meet every possible requirement that I saw in the project and I hope that I get a full-marks for both the milestones. Please note that I asked for extension that is why my last push is late.

Milestone 1 - Notes
Please connect the Internet while viewing the website because it uses BULMA css and also the images are hosted on imgbb.com and the real hyperlinks are used in the form as per the requirement of the website.
Please do not check the Wrong_Branch branch, it has nothing related to the master branch which has the website. Just that I did not want to lose my commits and wanted you to see the flaws and mistakes that I committed in the earlier stages.
Please use Chrome browser to view the website.
I have made various commits and made sure the website is exactly the same as in the demo.
